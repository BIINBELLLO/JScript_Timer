# JScript_Timer
A Simple Coming Soon Timer, With a working countdown timer. Easy to modify and implement on your website.
The only instruction here is to edit the javascript function responsible for displaying the timer, since you want the timer to be counting down to a
later date, what you need do is edit the 'var deadline = new Date("feb 28, 2019 23:59:59").getTime();' to a later date. Let's say you 
are cloning this in may, and you want your count down to end in June or July, just change this variable to reflect your new date. Eg. 
'var deadline = new Date("jun 28, 2019 23:59:59").getTime();'
